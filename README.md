# Visualizing-COVID-19
After learning R through Data Camp I took on this project (provided by Data Camp https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/870) to apply my newly learned skills. The code was created by me. The description of the project, the text in the notebook, and the outline of the code was provided by Data Camp. Within months, COVID-19 went from an epidemic to a pandemic. From the first identified case in December 2019, how did the virus spread so fast and widely? In this free R project, we will visualize data from the early months of the coronavirus outbreak to see how this virus grew to be a global pandemic.
